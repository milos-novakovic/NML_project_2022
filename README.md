## Dataset [AmazonProducts](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/torch_geometric/datasets/amazon_products.html)

The Amazon dataset from the ["GraphSAINT: Graph Sampling Based Inductive Learning Method"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04931) paper, containing products and its categories.

The Amazon dataset is processed from the bipartite user-item graph from Amazon.

The problem here is to predict an Amazon product category based on the text of the reviews. 

Details for the Amazon dataset are as follows:

* Node: One node in the Amazon Dataset represents one product listed on the Amazon website.
* Edge: We add an edge between two nodes A and B if the buyers of product A and the buyers of B overlaps.
* Node feature: The node feature contains information of all the reviews on that product. The feature representation is embedded in the length-200 feature vecotr (embedding) to serve as the GCN inputs.
* Node label: The label of one node represents the categories of the product (e.g., books, movie, shoes). This is multilabeled dataset, hence every node can have more than one label. The toal number of occuring possible categories is  107. A small percent of nodes may now have no label because they do not belong to any of the 107 categories.
* Train/Val/Test split: The Train/Val/Test nodes are randomly split to 0.85/0.05/0.10.
* The training adjacency matrix is generated by the induced sub-graph of the training nodes.

Raw and proceseed data used for

1. the **GraphSAINT** model is located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19qW5aq0C17Zqvv9sDmZn1sxlv3MPdYm1?usp=sharing).
2. the **MLP** (multilayer perceptron) and **GraphSAGE** models is located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KPE50zojEd0jMAY58ypHdF6sqfu71pb8?usp=sharing).

## Results

Results are provided in different locations for different models, therefore for the model:

1. ***GraphSAINT*** model training and evaluation output values are stored in two places, i.e., for the [node-sampler-output-file](GraphSAINT/node_sampler_training_evaluation_test_cleared.txt) and for the [random-walk-sampler-output-file](GraphSAINT/random_walk_sampler_training_evaluation_test_cleared.txt).
2. ***MLP*** model training and evaluation output values are stored in the corresponding [ipynb-file](MLP/Project_exploitation_MLP.ipynb).
3. ***GraphSAGE*** model training and evaluation output values are stored in the corresponding [ipynb-file](GraphSAGE/Project_exploitation_GraphSAGE.ipynb).
